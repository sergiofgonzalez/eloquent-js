# e02 &mdash; Mouse Trail
> creating a mouse trail

## Description
Implement a mouse trail using an absolutely positioned `<div>` elements with a fixed size and background color.

### Additional Notes
This example contains the [Open Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open) set of icons. It seems it is no longer a preferred option (as of [Bootstrap v4.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/extend/icons/#preferred)) but works just fine for this simple purposes.
The library was downloaded from [Open Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open) site, and a few unneeded directories were removed before pasting them on the `stylesheets/` directory.
