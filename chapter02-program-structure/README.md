# Chapter 2 - Program Structure

## e01-looping-a-triangle
Write a loop that makes seven calls to `console.log` to output the following triangle:

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

## e02-fizzbuzz
Write a program that uses `console.log` to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5.

## e03-chess-board
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines:
```
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
```

Once it works, modify the program so that it works for any size.
