> practising several concepts about a `<form>` and its fields.

## Description
The example demonstrates how you can use the `elements` element of a form to inspect its elements as an *array-like* and as a map, and also illustrates how to add an event handler for the `'submit'` event so that the default action (navigating to the page identified in the action) does not take place.
