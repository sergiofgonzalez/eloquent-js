# Chapter 17: Forms and Form Fields

## 01-hello-form-fields
Illustrates how the browser builds a query string from a form. In this example, a basic form with two elements using the `GET` method is created.

## 02-focus-and-blur
Illustrates how you can force an HTML form field to gain the focus, and a to lose it using JavaScript.

## 03-autofocus-tabindex
Illustrates the use of `autofocus` and `tabindex`.

## 04-disabled-fields
Illustrates the use of the `disabled` property in a form element.

## 05-hello-form
Illustrates the use of a normal `<form>` element that submits a couple of fields when a `submit` button is clicked and makes the browser navigate to the page referenced in the form's `action` attribute.
It is also illustrated how to access the form fields as an array and as a map.

## 06-javascript-in-forms
Illustrates how to capture `submit` events triggered by a form when the form is submitted. Instead of navigating away from the page, the JavaScript code calls `preventDefault` and displays the form field value on the console.

## 07-text-fields-properties
Illustrates how to work with text field properties such as `value`, `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` by wiring up a textarea with an event handler that introduces some text when F2 key is pressed.

## 08-text-fields-events
Illustrates how to work with `change` and `input` events on text fields by creating a counter that increments/decrements as the user interacts with the text field, and an status area in which the word to be validated is displayed when the field loses its focus.
