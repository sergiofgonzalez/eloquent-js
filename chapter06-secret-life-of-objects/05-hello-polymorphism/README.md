# 05 &mdash; Hello Polymorphism
> illustrates the basics of polymorphism by showing how to override the `toString` method for an object

## Description

Polymorphism is the technique that allows an object to respond differently from other objects that have the same prototype. 

This allows having different types of objects belonging to the same prototype tree to comply with the same interface while behaving completely different.

In the code it is demonstrated how to override the `toString` method for a class.
